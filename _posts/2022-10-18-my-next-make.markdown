Jenn and some friends had been maintaining a database of sewing patterns
scattered across some Google docs and Shopify metafields. She took the
time to polish it up and release it as an [online sewing pattern database](https://mynextmake.com/).

It's called My Next Make. Apparently sewists like to noun verbs just as much
as techies!

The database originally served to help recommend patterns to go with different
types of fabrics--knits, wovens, canvas, etc. Its focused primarily on independent
designers who publish A0 printer-friendly PDFs. As a result, it's mainly paid
patterns, but there are a smattering of free ones.

It seems kind of wild that this doesn't exist in a usable form yet. The
site currently tracks about 500 patterns, with [new patterns from over 50 designers](https://mynextmake.com/all-new-patterns)
being added each week.

Every page that lists patterns can be filtered to free/paid or knits/wovens. Jenn
hopes to add more advanced filtering parameters in the future, but even without
them, it's still a great resource for discovering new PDF patterns.

Anyway, check out [My Next Make](https://mynextmake.com/) and let Jenn know what
you think!
