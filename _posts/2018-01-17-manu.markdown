I'm officially an open source author!

I'll write a post about the specific thing later--for now, you can learn about
it at its GitHub [project page](https://github.com/cldellow/manu).

Creating and publishing this library was really refreshing. The ecosystem for
open source is full of really valuable things, given away for free.
It's easy to take it for granted.

In the course of this project, I used:

* [JavaFastPFOR](https://github.com/lemire/JavaFastPFOR/), for integer compression
* [Spark](https://github.com/perwendel/spark), for a web server framework
* [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) and [sqlite-jdbc](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc), for metadata storage

And, of course, the usual open source suspects: Ubuntu, vim, maven.

Even more amazing to me are the free services, which require an active ops team
to maintain:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/cldellow/manu), for hosting the code
* [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/cldellow/manu), for continuous integrations
* [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/cldellow/manu), for code coverage reporting
* The [Central Repository](http://central.sonatype.org/), for hosting the compiled product

Cumulatively, these things represents hundreds of thousands of hours of effort
by skilled practitioners. And they're available for me and you to use at no cost.

That's amazing. It's nice to be reminded of it.
