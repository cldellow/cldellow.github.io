It's crazy how much of the day-to-day job of a knowledge worker revolves around copying and
pasting.

Developer? You probably copy and paste from StackOverflow. It's [a whole thing](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/31/the-key-copy-paste/).

White-collar worker? You probably shuffle data into and out of reports and dashboards.

Heck, even [this BC Supreme Court judge says copying and pasting became an integral part
of managing his caseload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1dmer7gf1U).

In every job I have worked, I have had to write glue code to call APIs and dump
the results into CSVs. I have copied and pasted stuff from crappy web portals
into Google Sheets, then painstakingly lined up the data to do some analysis.
The last company I worked at built an entire business around a subset of this
pain.

So it's probably no surprise that I think there's a lot of opportunity to make
APIs more accessible and less painful for many, many people. And that's what
[SyncWith](https://syncwith.com/) is trying to do. Call any API, for example
[Google Analytics](https://syncwith.com/api/google-analytics-v3), see your data,
export it into Google Sheets, and keep it up to date, with no ongoing effort
on your part.

Give it a try!
