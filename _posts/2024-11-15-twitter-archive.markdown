When Twitter changed hands in 2022, I decided I didn't want to actively contribute to it:
I stopped posted and made my tweets private.

I've since exported my tweets to [cldellow's twitter archive](https://cldellow.com/tweets).
It's mainly for my own nostalgia, but posting it here because if a Thing Exists On
The Internet But Nobody Links To It, does it even really exist?
